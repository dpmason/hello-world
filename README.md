Hello dear reader!

I am sitting in the main library in the University of Bremen on a cold winters morning. The sun is barely poking through the clouds, seeping through the blinds while i am setting up my GitHub account. My name is Dominic and i am currently in the midst of my honours year. Lets hope its a good one ;).
